## Textures
This datapack comes with a texture pack that retexures all redstone componets to be easy to uses.

## Logic Gates

### AND
The AND Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side when all three of its input sides are receiving redstone power.

### NAND
The NAND Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side unless all three of its input sides are receiving redstone power.

### NOR
The NOR Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while none of its input sides are receiving redstone power.

### NOT
The NOT Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while its input side is not receiving power.

### OR
The OR Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while any of its three input sides are receiving redstone power.

### XNOR
The XNOR Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while both or neither of its input sides are receiving power.

### XOR
The XOR Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while one (but not both) of its input sides is receiving redstone power.
